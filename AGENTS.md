# Instructions for AI Agents

## Overview

This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows that produce
binary builds of the latest Erlang/OTP releases and publishes
them to GitHub, Launchpad, and so on.

## Workflows

The workflows under `.github/workflows` are partially generated using `./generate.py`, which uses
`erlang-*.json` and `elixir-*.json` JSON files as inputs.

The JSON files define what release series and distributions are supported for each package type (Erlang or Elixir).

Two workflows monitor the Erlang/OTP and Elixir repositories looking for new tags,
and update, commit `erlang-releases.json` and `elixir-releases.json`.
