    "body": "## Code snippets in diagnostics\r\n\r\nElixir v1.15 introduced a new compiler diagnostic format and the ability to print multiple error diagnostics per compilation (in addition to multiple warnings).\r\n\r\nWith Elixir v1.16, we also include code snippets in exceptions and diagnostics raised by the compiler. For example, a syntax error now includes a pointer to where the error happened:\r\n\r\n```\r\n** (SyntaxError) invalid syntax found on lib/my_app.ex:1:17:\r\n    error: syntax error before: '*'\r\n    │\r\n  1 │ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, *]\r\n    │                 ^\r\n    │\r\n    └─ lib/my_app.ex:1:17\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor mismatched delimiters, it now shows both delimiters:\r\n\r\n```\r\n** (MismatchedDelimiterError) mismatched delimiter found on lib/my_app.ex:1:18:\r\n    error: unexpected token: )\r\n    │\r\n  1 │ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\r\n    │ │                └ mismatched closing delimiter (expected \"]\")\r\n    │ └ unclosed delimiter\r\n    │\r\n    └─ lib/my_app.ex:1:18\r\n```\r\n\r\nErrors and warnings diagnostics also include code snippets. When possible, we will show precise spans, such as on undefined variables:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  error: undefined variable \"unknown_var\"\r\n  │\r\n5 │     a - unknown_var\r\n  │         ^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  │\r\n  └─ lib/sample.ex:5:9: Sample.foo/1\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise the whole line is underlined:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: function names should start with lowercase characters or underscore, invalid name CamelCase\r\n  │\r\n3 │   def CamelCase do\r\n  │   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  │\r\n  └─ lib/sample.ex:3\r\n```\r\n\r\nA huge thank you to Vinícius Muller for working on the new diagnostics.\r\n\r\n## Revamped documentation\r\n\r\nElixir's Getting Started guided has been made part of the Elixir repository and incorporated into ExDoc. This was an opportunity to revisit and unify all official guides and references.\r\n\r\nWe have also incorporated and extended the work on [Understanding Code Smells in Elixir Functional Language](https://github.com/lucasvegi/Elixir-Code-Smells/blob/main/etc/2023-emse-code-smells-elixir.pdf), by Lucas Vegi and Marco Tulio Valente, from [ASERG/DCC/UFMG](http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/), into the official document in the form of anti-patterns. The anti-patterns are divided into four categories: code-related, design-related, process-related, and meta-programming. Our goal is to give all developers examples of potential anti-patterns, with context and examples on how to improve their codebases.\r\n\r\nAnother [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) feature we have incorporated in this release is the addition of cheatsheets, starting with [a cheatsheet for the Enum module](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/enum-cheat.html). If you would like to contribute future cheatsheets to Elixir itself, feel free to start a discussion with an issue.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have started enriching our documentation with [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams. You can find examples in the [GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/GenServer.html) and [Supervisor](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/Supervisor.html) docs.\r\n\r\n## v1.16.0-rc.0 (2023-10-31)\r\n\r\n### 1. Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### EEx\r\n\r\n  * [EEx] Include relative file information in diagnostics\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Code] Automatically include columns in parsing options\r\n  * [Code] Introduce `MismatchedDelimiterError` for handling mismatched delimiter exceptions\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Handle anonymous calls in fragments\r\n  * [Code.Formatter] Trim trailing whitespace on heredocs with `\\r\\n`\r\n  * [Kernel] Suggest module names based on suffix and casing errors when the module does not exist in `UndefinedFunctionError`\r\n  * [Kernel.ParallelCompiler] Introduce `Kernel.ParallelCompiler.pmap/2` to compile multiple additional entries in parallel\r\n  * [Kernel.SpecialForms] Warn if `True`/`False`/`Nil` are used as aliases and there is no such alias\r\n  * [Macro] Add `Macro.compile_apply/4`\r\n  * [Module] Add support for `@nifs` annotation from Erlang/OTP 25\r\n  * [Module] Add support for missing `@dialyzer` configuration\r\n  * [String] Update to Unicode 15.1.0\r\n  * [Task] Add `:limit` option to `Task.yield_many/2`\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix] Add `MIX_PROFILE` to profile a list of comma separated tasks\r\n  * [mix compile.elixir] Optimize scenario where there are thousands of files in `lib/` and one of them is changed\r\n  * [mix test] Allow testing multiple file:line at once, such as `mix test test/foo_test.exs:13 test/bar_test.exs:27`\r\n\r\n### 2. Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Fix crash in `Code.Fragment.surround_context/2` when matching on `->`\r\n  * [IO] Raise when using `IO.binwrite/2` on terminated device (mirroring `IO.write/2`)\r\n  * [Kernel] Do not expand aliases recursively (the alias stored in Macro.Env is already expanded)\r\n  * [Kernel] Ensure `dbg` module is a compile-time dependency\r\n  * [Kernel] Warn when a private function or macro uses `unquote/1` and the function/macro itself is unused\r\n  * [Kernel] Do not define an alias for nested modules starting with `Elixir.` in their definition\r\n  * [Kernel.ParallelCompiler] Consider a module has been defined in `@after_compile` callbacks to avoid deadlocks\r\n  * [Path] Ensure `Path.relative_to/2` returns a relative path when the given argument does not share a common prefix with `cwd`\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit] Raise on incorrectly dedented doctests\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [Mix] Ensure files with duplicate modules are recompiled whenever any of the files change\r\n\r\n### 3. Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [File] Deprecate `File.stream!(file, options, line_or_bytes)` in favor of keeping the options as last argument, as in `File.stream!(file, line_or_bytes, options)`\r\n  * [Kernel.ParallelCompiler] Deprecate `Kernel.ParallelCompiler.async/1` in favor of `Kernel.ParallelCompiler.pmap/2`\r\n  * [Path] Deprecate `Path.safe_relative_to/2` in favor of `Path.safe_relative/2`\r\n\r\n### 4. Hard deprecations\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Date] Deprecate inferring a range with negative step, call `Date.range/3` with a negative step instead\r\n  * [Enum] Deprecate passing a range with negative step on `Enum.slice/2`, give `first..last//1` instead\r\n  * [Kernel] `~R/.../` is deprecated in favor of `~r/.../`. This is because `~R/.../` still allowed escape codes, which did not fit the definition of uppercase sigils\r\n  * [String] Deprecate passing a range with negative step on `String.slice/2`, give `first..last//1` instead\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit.Formatter] Deprecate `format_time/2`, use `format_times/1` instead\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix compile.leex] Require `:leex` to be added as a compiler to run the `leex` compiler\r\n  * [mix compile.yecc] Require `:yecc` to be added as a compiler to run the `yecc` compiler",

    "body": "Official announcement: https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2023/06/19/elixir-v1-15-0-released/\r\n\r\nThis release requires Erlang/OTP 24 and later.\r\n\r\nElixir v1.15 is a smaller release with focused improvements\r\non compilation and boot times. This release also completes\r\nour integration process with Erlang/OTP logger, bringing new\r\nfeatures such as log rotation and compaction out of the box.\r\n\r\nYou will also find additional convenience functions in `Code`,\r\n`Map`, `Keyword`, all Calendar modules, and others.\r\n\r\n## Compile and boot-time improvements\r\n\r\nThe last several releases brought improvements to compilation\r\ntime and this version is no different. In particular, Elixir\r\nnow caches and prunes load paths before compilation, ensuring your\r\nproject (and dependencies!) compile faster and in an environment\r\ncloser to production.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell the Erlang VM loads modules from code paths. Each\r\napplication that ships with Erlang and Elixir plus each dependency\r\nbecome an entry in your code path. The larger the code path, the\r\nmore work Erlang has to do in order to find a module.\r\n\r\nIn previous versions, Mix would only add entries to the load paths.\r\nTherefore, if you compiled 20 dependencies and you went to compile\r\nthe 21st, the code path would have 21 entries (plus all Erlang and\r\nElixir apps). This allowed modules from unrelated dependencies to\r\nbe seen and made compilation slower the more dependencies you had.\r\nWith this release, we will now prune the code paths to only the ones\r\nlisted as dependencies, bringing the behaviour closer to `mix release`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Erlang/OTP 26 allows us to start applications\r\nconcurrently and cache the code path lookups, decreasing the cost of\r\nbooting applications. The combination of Elixir v1.15 and Erlang/OTP 26\r\nshould reduce the boot time of applications, such as when starting\r\n`iex -S mix` or running a single test with `mix test`, from 5% to 30%.\r\n\r\nThe compiler is also smarter in several ways: `@behaviour` declarations\r\nno longer add compile-time dependencies and aliases in patterns and\r\nguards add no dependency whatsoever, as no dispatching happens. Furthermore,\r\nMix now tracks the digests of `@external_resource` files, reducing the\r\namount of recompilation when swapping branches. Finally, dependencies\r\nare automatically recompiled when their compile-time configuration changes.\r\n\r\n### Potential incompatibilities\r\n\r\nDue to the code path pruning, if you have an application or dependency\r\nthat does not specify its dependencies on Erlang and Elixir application,\r\nit may no longer compile successfully in Elixir v1.15. You can temporarily\r\ndisable code path pruning by setting `prune_code_paths: false` in your\r\n`mix.exs`, although doing so may lead to runtime bugs that are only\r\nmanifested inside a `mix release`.\r\n\r\n## Compiler warnings and errors\r\n\r\nThe Elixir compiler can now emit many errors for a single file, making\r\nsure more feedback is reported to developers before compilation is aborted.\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.14, an undefined function would be reported as:\r\n\r\n    ** (CompileError) undefined function foo/0 (there is no such import)\r\n        my_file.exs:1\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.15, the new reports will look like:\r\n\r\n    error: undefined function foo/0 (there is no such import)\r\n      my_file.exs:1\r\n\r\n    ** (CompileError) my_file.exs: cannot compile file (errors have been logged)\r\n\r\nA new function, called `Code.with_diagnostics/2`, has been added so this\r\ninformation can be leveraged by editors, allowing them to point to several\r\nerrors at once.\r\n\r\n### Potential incompatibilities\r\n\r\nAs part of this effort, the behaviour where undefined variables were\r\ntransformed into nullary function calls, often leading to confusing error\r\nreports, has been disabled during project compilation. You can invoke\r\n`Code.compiler_options(on_undefined_variable: :warn)`\r\nat the top of your `mix.exs` to bring the old behaviour back.\r\n\r\n## Integration with Erlang/OTP logger\r\n\r\nThis release provides additional features such as global logger\r\nmetadata and file logging (with rotation and compaction) out-of-the-box!\r\n\r\nThis release also soft-deprecates Elixir's Logger Backends in\r\nfavor of Erlang's Logger handlers. Elixir will automatically\r\nconvert your `:console` backend configuration into the new\r\nconfiguration. Previously, you would set:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nconfig :logger, :console,\r\n  level: :error,\r\n  format: \"$time $message $metadata\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is now translated to the equivalent:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nconfig :logger, :default_handler,\r\n  level: :error\r\n\r\nconfig :logger, :default_formatter,\r\n  format: \"$time $message $metadata\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you use `Logger.Backends.Console` with a custom device or other\r\nbackends, they are still fully supported and functional. If you\r\nimplement your own backends, you want to consider migrating to\r\n[`:logger_backends`](https://github.com/elixir-lang/logger_backends)\r\nin the long term.\r\n\r\nSee the new `Logger` documentation for more information on the\r\nnew features and on compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1. Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### EEx\r\n\r\n  * [EEx] Include source code snippets in syntax errors\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Calendar] Add support for epoch time (`%s`) to `Calendar.strftime/2`\r\n  * [Code] `Code.format_string!/2` now converts `'charlists'` into `~c\"charlists\"` by default\r\n  * [Code] Add `:on_undefined_variable` to the compiler options to preserve the warning behaviour which was deprecated back in Elixir v1.4\r\n  * [Code] Add `Code.loaded?/1` and `Code.ensure_all_loaded(!)/1`\r\n  * [Code] Add `Code.prepend_paths/1`, `Code.append_paths/1`, and `Code.delete_paths/1`\r\n  * [Code] Add `Code.with_diagnostics/2` to return diagnostics when compiling and evaluating code\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Support nested expressions in `Code.Fragment.cursor_context/1`\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Keep operators and no paren calls in `Code.Fragment.container_cursor_to_quoted/1`\r\n  * [Date] Add `Date.before?/2` and `Date.after?/2`\r\n  * [DateTime] Add `DateTime.before?/2` and `DateTime.after?/2`\r\n  * [DateTime] Support precision in `DateTime.utc_now/2`\r\n  * [File] Support distributed `File.Stream`\r\n  * [Inspect] `Inspect` now renders `'charlists'` as `~c\"charlists\"` by default\r\n  * [Kernel] Break down `case` and `cond` inside `dbg/2`\r\n  * [Kernel] Add `t:nonempty_binary/0` and `t:nonempty_bitstring/0`\r\n  * [Kernel] Treat `@behaviour`s as runtime dependencies\r\n  * [Kernel] Do not add runtime dependencies for alias references in patterns and guards\r\n  * [Kernel] Warn for nested calls without parens inside keywords\r\n  * [Kernel] Support for multi-letter uppercase sigils\r\n  * [Kernel] Introduce mechanism to collect several errors in a module. Previously, as soon as there was a compilation error, compilation would fail.

    "body": "This release requires Erlang/OTP 24 and later.\r\n\r\nElixir v1.15 is a smaller release with focused improvements\r\non compilation and boot times. This release also completes\r\nour integration process with Erlang/OTP logger, bringing new\r\nfeatures such as log rotation and compaction out of the box.\r\n\r\nYou will also find additional convenience functions in `Code`,\r\n`Map`, `Keyword`, all Calendar modules, and others.\r\n\r\n## Compile and boot-time improvements\r\n\r\nThe last several releases brought improvements to compilation\r\ntime and this version is no different. In particular, Elixir\r\nnow caches and prunes load paths before compilation, ensuring your\r\nproject (and dependencies!) compile faster and in an environment\r\ncloser to production.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell the Erlang VM loads modules from code paths. Each\r\napplication that ships with Erlang and Elixir plus each dependency\r\nbecome an entry in your code path. The larger the code path, the\r\nmore work Erlang has to do in order to find a module.\r\n\r\nIn previous versions, Mix would only add entries to the load paths.\r\nTherefore, if you compiled 20 dependencies and you went to compile\r\nthe 21st, the code path would have 21 entries (plus all Erlang and\r\nElixir apps). This allowed modules from unrelated dependencies to\r\nbe seen and made compilation slower the more dependencies you had.\r\nWith this release, we will now prune the code paths to only the ones\r\nlisted as dependencies, bringing the behaviour closer to `mix release`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Erlang/OTP 26 allows us to start applications\r\nconcurrently and cache the code path lookups, decreasing the cost of\r\nbooting applications. The combination of Elixir v1.15 and Erlang/OTP 26\r\nshould reduce the boot time of applications, such as when starting\r\n`iex -S mix` or running a single test with `mix test`, from 5% to 30%.\r\n\r\nThe compiler is also smarter in several ways: `@behaviour` declarations\r\nno longer add compile-time dependencies and aliases in patterns and\r\nguards add no dependency whatsoever, as no dispatching happens. Furthermore,\r\nMix now tracks the digests of `@external_resource` files, reducing the\r\namount of recompilation when swapping branches. Finally, dependencies\r\nare automatically recompiled when their compile-time configuration changes.\r\n\r\n### Potential incompatibilities\r\n\r\nDue to the code path pruning, if you have an application or dependency\r\nthat does not specify its dependencies on Erlang and Elixir application,\r\nit may no longer compile successfully in Elixir v1.15. You can temporarily\r\ndisable code path pruning by setting `prune_code_paths: false` in your\r\n`mix.exs`, although doing so may lead to runtime bugs that are only\r\nmanifested inside a `mix release`.\r\n\r\n## Compiler warnings and errors\r\n\r\nThe Elixir compiler can now emit many errors for a single file, making\r\nsure more feedback is reported to developers before compilation is aborted.\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.14, an undefined function would be reported as:\r\n\r\n    ** (CompileError) undefined function foo/0 (there is no such import)\r\n        my_file.exs:1\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.15, the new reports will look like:\r\n\r\n    error: undefined function foo/0 (there is no such import)\r\n      my_file.exs:1\r\n\r\n    ** (CompileError) nofile: cannot compile file (errors have been logged)\r\n\r\nA new function, called `Code.with_diagnostics/2`, has been added so this\r\ninformation can be leveraged by editors, allowing them to point to several\r\nerrors at once.\r\n\r\n## Integration with Erlang/OTP logger\r\n\r\nThis release provides additional features such as global logger\r\nmetadata and file logging (with rotation and compaction) out-of-the-box!\r\n\r\nThis release also soft-deprecates Elixir's Logger Backends in\r\nfavor of Erlang's Logger handlers. Elixir will automatically\r\nconvert your `:console` backend configuration into the new\r\nconfiguration. Previously, you would set:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nconfig :logger, :console,\r\n  level: :error,\r\n  format: \"$time $message $metadata\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is now translated to the equivalent:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nconfig :logger, :default_handler,\r\n  level: :error\r\n\r\nconfig :logger, :default_formatter,\r\n  format: \"$time $message $metadata\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you use `Logger.Backends.Console` or other backends, they are\r\nstill fully supported and functional. If you implement your own\r\nbackends, you want to consider migrating to\r\n[`:logger_backends`](https://github.com/elixir-lang/logger_backends)\r\nin the long term.\r\n\r\nSee the new `Logger` documentation for more information on the\r\nnew features and on compatibility.\r\n\r\n## v1.15.0-rc.0 (2022-05-22)\r\n\r\n### 1.

When migrating\r\nto Erlang/OTP 26, keep it mind it changes how maps are stored\r\ninternally and they will be printed and traversed in a different\r\norder (note maps never provided a guarantee of their order).\r\nTo aid migration, this release adds `:sort_maps` to `inspect`\r\ncustom options, in case you want to sort them before inspection:\r\n\r\n    inspect(map, custom_options: [sort_maps: true])\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Inspect] Add `:sort_maps` to `Inspect.Opts.custom_options`\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n\r\n  * [IEx] Support shell history in Erlang/OTP 26+\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix compile.elixir] Optimize application tracer\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Code] Properly handle blocks with comments in all cases in `Code.quoted_to_string_with_comments/2`\r\n  * [Kernel] Fix `debug_info/4` when returning core_v1\r\n  * [Kernel] Store complete path on `quote keep: true` to avoid invalid stacktraces\r\n  * [Kernel] Fix column count when tokenizing escaped interpolations\r\n  * [Stream] Fix `Stream.zip/1` hanging on empty list\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix format] Don't call formatter on directories",

    "body": "Elixir v1.14 brings many improvements to the debugging experience in Elixir\r\nand data-type inspection. It also includes a new abstraction for easy\r\npartitioning of processes called `PartitionSupervisor`, as well as improved\r\ncompilation times and error messages.\r\n\r\nElixir v1.14 is the last version to support Erlang/OTP 23. Consider updating\r\nto Erlang/OTP 24 or Erlang/OTP 25.\r\n\r\n## `dbg`\r\n\r\n`Kernel.dbg/2` is a new macro that's somewhat similar to `IO.inspect/2`, but\r\nspecifically tailored for **debugging**.\r\n\r\nWhen called, it prints the value of whatever you pass to it, plus the debugged\r\ncode itself as well as its location. This code:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# In my_file.exs\r\nfeature = %{name: :dbg, inspiration: \"Rust\"}\r\ndbg(feature)\r\ndbg(Map.put(feature, :in_version, \"1.14.0\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrints this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ elixir my_file.exs\r\n[my_file.exs:2: (file)]\r\nfeature #=> %{inspiration: \"Rust\", name: :dbg}\r\n\r\n[my_file.exs:3: (file)]\r\nMap.put(feature, :in_version, \"1.14.0\") #=> %{in_version: \"1.14.0\", inspiration: \"Rust\", name: :dbg}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`dbg/2` can do more. It's a macro, so it *understands Elixir code*. You can see\r\nthat when you pass a series of `|>` pipes to it. `dbg/2` will print the value\r\nfor every step of the pipeline. This code:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# In dbg_pipes.exs\r\n__ENV__.file\r\n|> String.split(\"/\", trim: true)\r\n|> List.last()\r\n|> File.exists?()\r\n|> dbg()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrints this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ elixir dbg_pipes.exs\r\n[dbg_pipes.exs:5: (file)]\r\n__ENV__.file #=> \"/home/myuser/dbg_pipes.exs\"\r\n|> String.split(\"/\", trim: true) #=> [\"home\", \"myuser\", \"dbg_pipes.exs\"]\r\n|> List.last() #=> \"dbg_pipes.exs\"\r\n|> File.exists?() #=> true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### IEx and Prying\r\n\r\n`dbg/2` supports configurable backends. IEx automatically replaces the default\r\nbackend by one that halts the code execution with `IEx.Pry`, giving developers\r\nthe option to access local variables, imports, and more. This also works with\r\npipelines: if you pass a series of `|>` pipe calls to `dbg` (or pipe into it at the\r\nend, like `|> dbg()`), you'll be able to step through every line in the pipeline.\r\n\r\nYou can keep the default behaviour by passing the `--no-pry` option to IEx.\r\n\r\n## PartitionSupervisor\r\n\r\n`PartitionSupervisor` is a new module that implements a new supervisor type. The\r\npartition supervisor is designed to help with situations where you have a single\r\nsupervised process that becomes a bottleneck. If that process's state can be\r\neasily partitioned, then you can use `PartitionSupervisor` to supervise multiple\r\nisolated copies of that process running concurrently, each assigned its own\r\npartition.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine you have an `ErrorReporter` process that you use to report\r\nerrors to a monitoring service.\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# Application supervisor:\r\nchildren = [\r\n  # ...,\r\n  ErrorReporter\r\n]\r\n\r\nSupervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the concurrency of your application goes up, the `ErrorReporter` process\r\nmight receive requests from many other processes and eventually become a\r\nbottleneck. In a case like this, it could help to spin up multiple copies of the\r\n`ErrorReporter` process under a `PartitionSupervisor`.\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# Application supervisor\r\nchildren = [\r\n  {PartitionSupervisor, child_spec: ErrorReporter, name: Reporters}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `PartitionSupervisor` will spin up a number of processes equal to\r\n`System.schedulers_online()` by default (most often one per core). Now, when\r\nrouting requests to `ErrorReporter` processes we can use a `:via` tuple and\r\nroute the requests through the partition supervisor.\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\npartitioning_key = self()\r\nErrorReporter.report({:via, PartitionSupervisor, {Reporters, partitioning_key}}, error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `self()` as the partitioning key here means that the same process will\r\nalways report errors to the same `ErrorReporter` process, ensuring a form of\r\nback-pressure. You can use any term as the partitioning key.\r\n\r\n### A Common Example\r\n\r\nA common and practical example of a good use case for `PartitionSupervisor` is\r\npartitioning something like a `DynamicSupervisor`. When starting many processes\r\nunder it, a dynamic supervisor can be a bottleneck, especially if said processes\r\ntake a long time to initialize. Instead of starting a single `DynamicSupervisor`,\r\nyou can start multiple:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nchildren = [\r\n  {PartitionSupervisor, child_spec: DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.DynamicSupervisors}\r\n]\r\n\r\nSupervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you start processes on the dynamic supervisor for the right partition.\r\nFor instance, you can partition by PID, like in the previous example:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nDynamicSupervisor.start_child(\r\n  {:via, PartitionSupervisor, {MyApp.DynamicSupervisors, self()}},\r\n  my_child_specification\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Improved errors on binaries and evaluation\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 25 improved errors on binary construction and evaluation. These improvements\r\napply to Elixir as well. Before v1.14, errors when constructing binaries would\r\noften be hard-to-debug generic \"argument errors\". With Erlang/OTP 25 and Elixir v1.14,\r\nmore detail is provided for easier debugging. This work is part of [EEP\r\n54](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0054).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nint = 1\r\nbin = \"foo\"\r\nint <> bin\r\n#=> ** (ArgumentError) argument error\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nint = 1\r\nbin = \"foo\"\r\nint <> bin\r\n#=> ** (ArgumentError) construction of binary failed:\r\n#=>    segment 1 of type 'binary':\r\n#=>    expected a binary but got: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Slicing with steps\r\n\r\nElixir v1.12 introduced **stepped ranges**, which are ranges where you can\r\nspecify the \"step\":\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nEnum.to_list(1..10//3)\r\n#=> [1, 4, 7, 10]\r\n```\r\n\r\nStepped ranges are particularly useful for numerical operations involving\r\nvectors and matrices (see [Nx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx), for example).\r\nHowever, the Elixir standard library was not making use of stepped ranges in its\r\nAPIs. Elixir v1.14 starts to take advantage of steps with support for stepped\r\nranges in a couple of functions. One of them is `Enum.slice/2`:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nletters = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\"]\r\nEnum.slice(letters, 0..5//2)\r\n#=> [\"a\", \"c\", \"e\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`binary_slice/2` (and `binary_slice/3` for completeness) has been added to the\r\n`Kernel` module, that works with bytes and also support stepped ranges:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nbinary_slice(\"Elixir\", 1..5//2)\r\n#=> \"lxr\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expression-based inspection and `Inspect` improvements\r\n\r\nIn Elixir, it's conventional to implement the `Inspect` protocol for opaque\r\nstructs so that they're inspected with a special notation, resembling this:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nMapSet.new([:apple, :banana])\r\n#MapSet<[:apple, :banana]>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is generally done when the struct content or part of it is private and the\r\n`%name{...}` representation would reveal fields that are not part of the public\r\nAPI.\r\n\r\nThe downside of the `#name<...>` convention is that *the inspected output is not\r\nvalid Elixir code*. For example, you cannot copy the inspected output and paste\r\nit into an IEx session.\r\n\r\nElixir v1.14 changes the convention for some of the standard-library structs.\r\nThe `Inspect` implementation for those structs now returns a string with a valid\r\nElixir expression that recreates the struct when evaluated. In the `MapSet`\r\nexample above, this is what we have now:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nfruits = MapSet.new([:apple, :banana])\r\nMapSet.put(fruits, :pear)\r\n#=> MapSet.new([:apple, :banana, :pear])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `MapSet.new/1` expression evaluates to exactly the struct that we're\r\ninspecting. This allows us to hide the internals of `MapSet`, while keeping\r\nit as valid Elixir code. This expression-based inspection has been\r\nimplemented for `Version.Requirement`, `MapSet`, and `Date.Range`.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have improved the `Inspect` protocol for structs so that\r\nfields are inspected in the order they are declared in `defstruct`.\r\nThe option `:optional` has also been added when deriving the `Inspect`\r\nprotocol, giving developers more control over the struct representation.\r\nSee the updated documentation for `Inspect` for a general rundown on\r\nthe approaches and options available.\r\n\r\n### 1.

This should make the usage of Mix inside projects quite more responsive\r\n\r\n### Checksums\r\n\r\n  * Precompiled.zip SHA1: 051c2728bfd679d1d6f74d11f25ca679491cd6b4\r\n  * Precompiled.zip SHA512: 38eb2281032b0cb096ef5e61f048c5374d6fb9bf4078ab8f9526a42e16e7c661732a632b55d6072328eedf87a47e6eeb3f0e3f90bba1086239c71350f90c75e5\r\n  * Docs.zip SHA1: a3573b1a759944669dec951b38d3a978e17ba535\r\n  * Docs.zip SHA512: ed1d9814e53a7d8abb13354f1772881640f84cb55dd6f4fdf24465b871aae5561d0b64627b2cba03dd00494c1822ce1108956b02cdaa230d41ce7e5c6ede1222",
